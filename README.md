# RBERT for Relation Extraction task for KLUE

## Project Description

- Relation Extraction task is one of [Korean Language Understanding Evaluation(KLUE) Benchmark](https://github.com/KLUE-benchmark/KLUE)'s task. 
- Relation extraction can be defined as multiclass classification task for relationship between subject entity and object entity.
- Labels are such as `no_relation`, `per:employee_of`, `org:founded_by` totaling 30 labels. 
- This repo contains custom dataset, custom training code utilizing [monologg's R-BERT Implementation](https://github.com/monologg/R-BERT).
- Custom labeling with [Pororo NER](https://github.com/kakaobrain/pororo/blob/master/pororo/tasks/named_entity_recognition.py) has been added to the dataset prior to the model's training.
